## Walkthrough

* The **BankAccount** class represents a bank account with properties like balance, account holder name, and account type.
* We use a **switch statement** for handling **deposit**, **withdrawal**, and **balance** check actions based on the user's choice.
* **Try-catch-finally statements** are used to **handle exceptions**, such as ***insufficient funds*** or ***invalid inputs*** during a ***withdrawal***.
* The HTML file (**`index.html`**) sets up the user interface with buttons for actions and an input field to enter the **amount**.
* The JavaScript file (**`script.js`**) defines the **BankAccount** class, functions for actions, and exception handling using ***try-catch***.
* The CSS file (**`styles.css`**) styles the webpage for a **clean** and **user-friendly** interface.
